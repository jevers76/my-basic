# Introduction #
MY-BASIC is a tiny cross-platform easy extendable BASIC interpreter written in pure C with about 5000 lines of source code. Its grammar is similar to structured BASIC in early era, but without line number. It is aimed to be either an embeddable scripting language or a standalone interpreter. The core is pretty light; all in a C source file and an associated header file. You can combine MY-BASIC with an existing C / C++ / Objective-C project easily, that can make them more powerful.
