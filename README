Introduction
	MY-BASIC is a tiny cross-platform easy extendable BASIC interpreter written
	in pure C with about 5000 lines of source code. Its grammar is similar
	to structured BASIC in early era, but without line number. It is aimed to
	be either an embeddable scripting language or a standalone interpreter. The
	core is pretty light; all in a C source file and a header file. You can
	combine MY-BASIC with an existing C / C++ / Objective-C project easily,
	that can make them more powerful.
