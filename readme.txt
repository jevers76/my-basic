Introduction
MY-BASIC is a tiny BASIC interpreter written in pure C. It has an early structured BASIC like grammar but without line number. It is aimed to be either an embeddable scripting language or a stand alone interpreter. It can be combined with an existing C/C++/Objective-C project easily and power them up.
