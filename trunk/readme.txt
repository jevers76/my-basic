Introduction
MY-BASIC is a tiny BASIC interpreter written in pure C within about 5000 lines of source code. It has an early structured BASIC like grammar but without line number. It is aimed to be either an embeddable scripting language or a stand alone interpreter. The core is pretty light; all in a C source file and a header file. It can be combined with an existing C / C++ / Objective-C project easily and power it up.
