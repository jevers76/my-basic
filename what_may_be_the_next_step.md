# What may be the next step? #

Yet MY-BASIC is only a simple implementation which is similar to traditional BASIC versions in syntax, the author who is a crazy game coder would like to keep it simple but make it more powerful and more flexible.

## Key features to be done ##

Data structures:
  * Dynamic generic type.
  * List support.
  * Table support.

Basic syntax:
  * More flexible IF-ELIF-ELSE-ENDIF statement.
  * IMPORT statement.

Advanced syntax:
  * Tuple values return.
  * YIELD statement.

Functional programming:
  * [Lambda](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_%28programming%29).
  * Closure.
  * Coroutine.
