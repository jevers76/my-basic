# Who are using #

It will be very appreciated if you left a message in this thread if MY-BASIC helped you; this message would be great encouraging for the developer and useful for other users to know MY-BASIC could help more people. Some project type, target machine architecture, compiler name and version, scripting usage, etc. information would be very valuable.
